# awsTollCalc
Used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that hosted a toll calculator. The Toll calculator would tell you how much it will cost from on exit to another on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

Deployed a reliable system by configuring VPCs, Subnets, Security Groups, Load Balancers, and Auto Scaling Groups
that could handle a volume up to 400%

**AWS instances, vpc, etc. cancelled.
